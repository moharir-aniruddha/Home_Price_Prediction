# üè° Home Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a full-stack web application that predicts house prices based on various features using a machine learning model.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a reliable estimate of house prices for a given location, area, and number of rooms. The application is split into two parts: a **backend server** that hosts the trained machine learning model and a **client-side web interface** for user interaction.

The model is trained on historical real estate data and is designed to provide quick and accurate predictions, making it a valuable tool for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Location-Based Prediction:** Users can select the location from a dropdown menu for accurate, locality-specific pricing.
* **Input Fields:** Accepts key inputs like **Area (in square feet)**, **Number of Bedrooms**, and **Number of Bathrooms**.
* **Intuitive UI:** A clean and professional web interface built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```

### **Running the Application**

1.  Go to the server folder and run the Python server:
    ```bash
    cd server
    python server.py
    ```
2.  Go to the client folder and start a simple HTTP server:
    ```bash
    cd client
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
3.  In your web browser, navigate to the following address:
    ```
